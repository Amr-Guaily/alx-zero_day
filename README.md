My first readme

### Task 3
A branch is like a copy of your project. It’s used mainly for:

adding a feature in development
collaborating on the same project with other developers
not breaking your entire repository
not upsetting your co-workers
The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.

### Task 4
For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.
